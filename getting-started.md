> Next.js 13 was recently released, [learn more](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) and see the [upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading#upgrading-from-12-to-13). Version 13 also introduces beta features like the [`app` directory](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/app-directory-roadmap) that works alongside the `pages` directory (stable) for incremental adoption. You can continue using `pages` in Next.js 13, but if you want to try the new `app` features, [see the new beta docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs).
